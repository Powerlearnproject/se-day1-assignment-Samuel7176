# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    It systematically applies engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  a.Planning-It involves defining the software's purpose and scope
  b.Requirement-It seeks to iidentify and record the precise requirements of the final users
  c.Design-It is all about building a framework
  d.Coding-This phase aims to develop software that is functional efficient and user friendly
  e.Testing-It is a thorough examination of the software for any bugs or glitches that may occur during coding
  f.Deployment-Rolling out the software to its end-users.Also ensuring the software can be operated with ease
  g.Maintenance-Characterised by constant assistance and improvement which ensures best functioning of the software
  
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  a.Waterfall-This is a linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed prior to moving to the next step.eg software engineering
  b.Agile-Flexible and iterative,emphasizing continous feedback and adaptation.eg project design

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  a.Software developer-writing the code and dveloping the entire software product
  b.Quality assurance engineer-creating and performing tests,identifyin errors and providing feeback to verify the final product meets a company's quality equirements
  c.Project manager-planning,scheduling and managing the delivery of software and web projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  a.IDEs-helps programmers develop software code efficiently.It combines capabilities such as software editing,building,testing and packaging in an eas-to-use application
  b.VCS-they allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously,each making their changes in a controlled and isolated manner

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  a.Lack of workflow  visibility.Invest in tools that empower your teams to make data driven decisions
  b.Broken SDLC processes.Documentation
  c.Lack of predictability in software delivery.Minimize external dependability,especially,avoid getting locked in the cloud

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  a.Unit-Test individual components
  b.Integration-Test integrated components
  c.System-test the entire system
  d.Acceptnce-test the final system

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt.It enhances the user-AI interaction so the AI understands the user's intention
  even with minimal input

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
